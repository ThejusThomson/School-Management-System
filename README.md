# School Management System - CSYE6200 - Object Oriented Design
## Project Overview
This Java school project is a comprehensive management system that provides functionalities for user authentication (login/logout), managing students, teachers, and classrooms. The project incorporates a Swing-based frontend, MySQL database integration, and various Java features such as OOP, Lambdas, inner classes, Exception Handling, Design Patterns, and Comparators.

## Project Structure
The project follows the Maven directory structure, ensuring a clean and organized codebase. Key directories include:

- src/main/java: Contains the Java source code.
- src/main/resources: Houses configuration files and sample CSV data.
- src/test: Contains test classes.
- target: The default output directory for compiled classes and JAR files.

## Technologies Used
- Java 1.8: Leverages Java's latest features.
- Maven: Manages dependencies, builds the project, and creates executable JAR files.
- Swing: Implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interactions.
- MySQL: Integrates with a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.
- CSV File Handling: Reads and writes data to CSV files for additional data management.
- OOP Concepts: Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles for a modular and extensible codebase.
- Lambdas: Employs Lambdas for concise and expressive code.
- Inner Classes: Uses inner classes to encapsulate functionality.
- Exception Handling: Implements robust error handling to handle unexpected situations.
- Design Patterns: Incorporates multiple design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Observer) for improved code organization.
- Comparators: Utilizes Comparators for custom sorting of data.

## Functionality
### 1. Authentication
- Login: Users can log in with valid credentials.
- Logout: Users can log out to terminate their session securely.
### 2. Student Management
- View Students: Displays a list of all students.
- Add Student: Allows the addition of new students.
### 3. Teacher Management
- View Teachers: Displays a list of all teachers.
- Add Teacher: Allows the addition of new teachers.
### 4. Classroom Management
- View Classrooms: Displays a list of all classrooms.
- Map Student and Teacher: Associates students and teachers within a classroom.
